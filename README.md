# What is this?

This is *essentially* a mirror of v1.0 of LPEG (retrieved 11/10/18, http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/lpeg/ ), with the makefile changed and LICENSE + README file additions.

We did very little to change this source code. Nearly all of it is Roberto Ierusalimschy's invention, please give him thanks!
